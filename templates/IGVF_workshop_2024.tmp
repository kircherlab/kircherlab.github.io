              <h1 class="post-title">Massively Parallel Reporter Assays: From Sequence Design to Machine Learning Applications</h1>
            </header>
            <p>We like to announce a workshop on Massively Parallel Reporter Assays: From Sequence Design to Machine Learning Applications, which will take place at the University of L&uuml;beck from Wednesday, February 28 to Friday, March 1, 2024.</p>
                        <h2>Details</h2>
			<p>This workshop is part of the <a href="https://igvf.org">IGVF consortium</a>, a network of researchers and institutions working on integrative genomics and functional validation of genetic variants. The aim of the workshop is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art methods and challenges in the field of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which are powerful tools for measuring the functional effects of thousands of DNA sequences in parallel.</p>

			<p>The workshop will cover topics such as:
			<ul>
			<li>Applications of MPRAs, including machine learning models for regulatory sequence effects</li>
			<li>Sequence selection, experimental controls and optimization of MPRA designs</li>
			<li>Effect quantification, statistical analysis of MPRA data and downstream considerations</li>
			</ul></p>
			
			The workshop will feature three keynote speakers who are leading experts in their respective domains:
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/michael-love-phd/">Mike Love</a>, Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina, who will talk about his work on developing MPRA assays and applying statistical methods for high-throughput sequencing data.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.nki.nl/research/research-groups/bas-van-steensel/">Bas van Steensel</a>, Group Leader at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, who will present his research on using MPRAs to study chromatin structure and other mechanisms of gene regulation.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Avsecz">&Zcaron;iga Avsec</a>, Research Scientist at DeepMind, who will discuss his work on using deep learning models for coding and non-coding sequences.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<p>The workshop will also include poster presentations by participants, as well as four hands-on and interactive sessions on relevant practical skills for the design and analysis of MPRAs. We will provide an open environment for discussions and networking. The workshop is intended for researchers and students who are interested in or working on MPRAs or related topics.</p> 

                        <p>By organizing a European workshop for the US-centered IGVF consortium, we wish to provide training for scientists inside and outside the consortium and want to contribute to the IGVF outreach efforts by introducing its mission and resources. We hope to build and foster a European network around the IGVF efforts and to connect different parts of the international research community around MPRAs and the study of regulatory variant effects.</p>

			<h2>Tentative schedule</h2>
			<p>We will provide a more detailed tentative schedule before the holiday break (i.e. by Dec 22, 2023). The workshop will start at 2pm on Feb 28, 2024 and end on the first day at 9pm. The first day will have the opportunity (i.e. no requirement) to present the participants (related) work in a poster session (before and over dinner) and end with a first key note. The second day (Feb 29) will start at 9am and end at 6pm. Day 3 (Mar 1) will start at 9am and end before 2pm.</p>
