<p>We are looking for a second PostDoc in our L&uuml;beck office. This PostDoc will be involved across projects of the lab and should support teaching and mentoring activities. This for example includes close interactions with the <a href="https://igvf.org">IGVF consortium</a> and our close collaborators Jay Shendure (University of Washington, Seattle), Nadav Ahituv (UCSF) and Michael Speicher (Medical University of Graz). We are currently preparing a detailed descriptions and an application form on the UKSH website. Feel free to enquire about details already.</p>

<p>Generally, please contact us to enquire about PostDoc and PhD positions. Typically, positions would be located at the University of L&uuml;beck, Germany less than hour away from Hamburg. In Berlin, we usually recruit PhD students through the IRTG 2403 and HEIBRiDS graduate programs. We are also supervising internships (that are part of study programs) and thesis projects at both the Berlin and L&uuml;beck sites.</p>
