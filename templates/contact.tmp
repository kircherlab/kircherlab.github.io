<!-- <p>We have an open PhD position at our L&uuml;beck office. You want to study how biological function and gene regulation are encoded in our genomes? You have a Master's degree or equivalent in bioinformatics, computational biology or similar, alternatively in computer sciences with experience in molecular biology and large-scale data analysis? The <a href="https://jobs.uksh.de/job/L%C3%BCbeck-PhD-student-computational-biology-bioinformatics-%28mfd%29-%28fulltime%29-Schl-23538/895999501/">call is still open till April 23, 2023</a>.</p> -->

<p>We are looking for interested student assistants with skills in programming and/or machine learning for at least one year contracts. Most of our work is performed in Python and R and we actively use Unix-based commandlines, vscode, snakemake, github and slurm in HPC environments. Student assistants will be involved across projects of the lab, like the study of different genetic variant effects as well as the the composition of cell-free DNA. This may entail their close interaction with the <a href="https://igvf.org">IGVF consortium</a> and our collaborators Jay Shendure (University of Washington, Seattle), Nadav Ahituv (UCSF) and Michael Speicher (Medical University of Graz). We are also supervising internships (unpaid and that are part of study programs) and thesis projects at both the Berlin and L&uuml;beck sites.</p> 

<p>We plan on advertising a PostDoc or senior staff scientist in our L&uuml;beck office in the near future. They will be involved across projects of the lab and should support teaching and mentoring activities. They will collaborate with members of the <a href="https://igvf.org">IGVF consortium</a> and our close collaborators Jay Shendure (University of Washington, Seattle), Nadav Ahituv (UCSF) and Michael Speicher (Medical University of Graz). We are currently preparing a detailed descriptions and an application form on the UKSH website. Feel free to enquire about details already.</p>

<p>Generally, please contact us to enquire about potential PostDoc, PhD and student assistant positions. Positions would be located at the University of L&uuml;beck, Germany (less than hour away from Hamburg) or at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charit&eacute; in Berlin. In Berlin, we typically recruit PhD students through the IRTG 2403 and HEIBRiDS graduate programs. We supervise unpaid internships (that are part of study programs) and thesis projects at both the Berlin and L&uuml;beck sites.</p>

<h2 id="visiting-address">Visiting Address in Berlin</h2>

<p>We are located on Charit&eacute; Campus Mitte just a short (&lt; 10 min) walk away from the main train station (Hauptbahnhof). The closest bus and tram stop is Invalidenpark. The closest S- and U-Bahn stop is Hauptbahnhof.</p>

<p>Our campus address is Virchowweg 20 but it is easiest to enter the building via Invalidenstra&szlig;e 80. The two buildings are connected and you can find us on level 03, following signs to the BIH Core Unit Bioinformatics (CUBI).</p>
