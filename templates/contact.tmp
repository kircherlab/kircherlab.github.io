<h3>Student assistants and thesis projects</h3>
<p>We are always looking for interested student assistants with skills in programming and/or machine learning for one or two year contracts. Most of our work is performed in Python and R and we actively use Unix-based command line (bash), vscode, snakemake, GitHub and slurm in HPC environments. Student assistants will be involved across projects of the lab, like the study of different genetic variant effects as well as the the composition of cell-free DNA. This may entail their close interaction with the <a href="https://igvf.org">IGVF consortium</a> and our collaborators Jay Shendure (University of Washington, Seattle), Nadav Ahituv (UCSF) and the Human Genetics institute at Medical University of Graz. We are also supervising internships (unpaid and that are part of study programs) and thesis projects at both the Berlin and L&uuml;beck sites.</p> 

<h3>Other positions</h3>
<p>Generally, please contact us to enquire about potential PostDoc, PhD and student assistant positions. Positions would be located at the University of L&uuml;beck, Germany (less than hour away from Hamburg) or at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charit&eacute; in Berlin. In Berlin, we typically recruit PhD students through the IRTG 2403 and HEIBRiDS graduate programs, and potentially through a newly established graduate program by BIH. We supervise unpaid internships (that are part of study programs) and thesis projects at both the Berlin and L&uuml;beck sites.</p>
