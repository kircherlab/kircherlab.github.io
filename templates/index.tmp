              The Kircher Lab studies genetic variant effects throughout the genome and across variant classes. 
              We are developing computational methods to predict the deleteriousness of genetic variants, study the effects of non-coding 
              sequence alterations (e.g. using massively parallel reporter assays and functional read outs) and analyze 
              cell-type contributions of cell-free DNA. We can be found at two locations. We are part of the Institute for Human Genetics 
              of the University of L&uuml;beck (UzL) and the University Medical Center Schleswig Holstein (UKSH), where we are 
              <a href="contact.html">located</a> in the BMF building on the Campus L&uuml;beck. We are also part of the 
              <a href="https://www.bihealth.org">Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)</a>, the translational research institute of 
              <a href="https://www.charite.de/en">Charit&eacute; - Universit&auml;tsmedizin Berlin</a>, where we are 
              <a href="contact.html">located</a> at the Charit&eacute; Campus Mitte.
