            <a href="https://cadd-sv.bihealth.org/">CADD-SV</a> - CADD-SV is a framework to estimate the impact of Structural Variants (SVs) in the human genome. We combine various annotations to predict the deleteriousness of human deletions. We provide a webserver for easy scoring and download of pre-scored SVs.
